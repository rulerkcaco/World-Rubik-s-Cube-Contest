<p>Race history
    On June 5, 1982, the first World Rubik's Cube Championship was held in Budapest, Hungary. At that time, only a third-order Rubik's Cube was set up. 19 contestants from 19 different countries participated in the competition. Although the organizers decided to continue to hold competitions in the future, but in the following years, the upsurge of Rubik's Cube in the world gradually faded. In 2003, Rubik's Cube fans held the second World Championships in Toronto. This can be called the "first modern Rubik's Cube competition" and achieved great success[2], but there are also many problems, very big Partly because of the lack of organizational supervision. The following year, WCA was formally established. WCA recognized the nature and results of the previous two competitions as World Championships, and formally established a system of holding the World Championships every two years.</p>
<p>The World Rubik's Cube Competition is organized by the World Rubik's Cube Association. The World Rubik's Cube Association (WCA) is an organization that manages the affairs of Rubik's Cube events worldwide. WCA was originally founded by Ron van Bruchem from the Netherlands and Mao Taisheng from the United States. [1] The mission of the World Rubik's Cube Association is "Hold more competitions in more countries, so that more friends can have fun in a fair and just atmosphere." [2] On November 20, 2007, they decided to WCA is registered as a non-profit organization. In 2017, California officially accepted the registration of the World Rubik's Cube Association.

    The World Rubik's Cube Association is managed by its board of directors, and has different teams, committees, and WCA representatives who are qualified to organize official competitions. Only when a WCA representative is present at the certification competition will it be recognized by the WCA. As of July 2019, more than 127,000 Rubik's Cube enthusiasts from all over the world have participated in the WCA event and have become WCA members whose results have been recorded and recognized</p>
